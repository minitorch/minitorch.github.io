Autodifferentiation
====================

   :hide-code:

      from minitorch import ScalarFunction
      import sys
      sys.path.append("../project/")
      from datasets_plotly import plot_function

In :doc:`scalar`, we have seen that :class:`ScalarFunction` can be used to
implement Functions on Variables. We do this by calling `apply` function on
Variables, which then calls the underlying `forward` function.

(For notation, we still use capital letters to refer to our
new Functions and Variables to distringuish them from Python functions
and variables.
We use functions to refer to mathmatical functions as well depending on
the context.)

Now, we include additional information on the class which gives the
derivative of the individual function. The trick behind autodifferentiation
is to use a `chain` of function calls to compute a derivative.
Just like `forward` calculates the function `f(x)`, we need a `backward` method
to provide this local derivative information.



Backward
-----------------------------

For every Function, we need to provide a `backward` method to compute its
derivative
information. Specifically, `backward` computes :math:`f'(x) \times d_{out}`
where
:math:`d_{out}` is an argument passed in (discussed below).

For the simple function :math:`f(x) = x \times 5`, we can consult our
derivative rules and get :math:`f'(x) = 5`. Therefore the `backward` is

.. jupyter-execute::

      class TimesFive(ScalarFunction):
          @staticmethod
          def forward(ctx, x):
              return x * 5

          @staticmethod
          def backward(ctx, d_out):
              f_prime = 5
              return f_prime * d_out


.. image:: figs/Autograd/autograd3.png
           :align: center


For functions that take multiple arguments, `backward` returns multiple
deritatives
with respect to each input argument. For example, if the function computes
:math:`f(x, y)`, we need to return :math:`f'_x(x, y)` and :math:`f'_y(x, y)`

.. jupyter-execute::


      class Mul(ScalarFunction):
          @staticmethod
          def forward(ctx, x, y):
              # Compute f(x, y)
              pass

          @staticmethod
          def backward(ctx, d_out):
              # Compute f'_x(x, y) * d_out, f'_y(x, y) * d_out
              pass

.. image:: figs/Autograd/autograd4.png
           :align: center

For :math:`f(x, y) = x + 2 \times y`, we can consult our
derivative rules again and get :math:`f'_x(x, y) = 1` and :math:`f'_y(x, y)
= 2`. Therefore the `backward` is

.. jupyter-execute::


      class AddTimes2(ScalarFunction):
          @staticmethod
          def forward(ctx, x, y):
              return x + 2 * y

          @staticmethod
          def backward(ctx, d_out):
              return d_out, 2 * d_out

.. jupyter-execute::

   def call(y):
        return AddTimes2.forward(None, 10, y)

   plot_function("Add Times 2: x=10", call)


.. jupyter-execute::

   def d_call(y):
        return AddTimes2.backward(None, 1)[1]

   plot_function("d Add Times 2: x=10", d_call)


Note that `backward` works a bit different than the
mathematical notation. Sometimes the function for the derivative
:math:`f'(x)` depends directly on x; however, `backward` does not take
:math:`x` as an argument. This is not a problem for the example functions
above, but things get a bit more interesting when the derivative also
depends on :math:`x` itself. This is where the context arguments `ctx`
comes in.

Consider a function `Square`, :math:`f(x) = x^2` that squares x
and has derivative :math:`f'(x) = 2 \times x`. We write it in code as

.. jupyter-execute::


      class Square(ScalarFunction):
          @staticmethod
          def forward(ctx, x):
              ctx.save_for_backward(x)
              return x * x

          @staticmethod
          def backward(ctx, d_out):
              x = ctx.saved_values
              f_prime = 2 * x
              return f_prime * d_out


.. jupyter-execute::

   def call(x):
        # You don't need to do this manually
        # It gets called automatically in `apply`
        ctx = minitorch.Context()
        return Square.forward(ctx, x)

   plot_function("Square", call)


.. jupyter-execute::

   def d_call(x):
        ctx = minitorch.Context()
        Square.forward(ctx, x)
        return Square.backward(ctx, 1)

   plot_function("d Square", d_call)


This type of function requires to explicitly save anything in `forward`
that we might need in `backward`.
This is a code optimization that limits the amount of storage required by
the computation process.


Chain Rule
-------------

.. note::
   This section discusses implementation of the chain rule for univariate
   differentiation.
   Before reading, review the mathematical definition of `Chain Rule
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule#Statement>`_ .


The above section gives the formula for running `backward` on one function,
but what if
we need to run `backward` on two functions in sequence?

.. image:: figs/Autograd/chain1.png
           :align: center

We can do so using the univariate chain rule:


.. math ::

    f'_x(g(x)) = g'(x) \times f'_{g(x)}(g(x))


If the notation gets a bit hard to follow here, naming each part may be
easier to
understand:

.. math::

   \begin{eqnarray*}
   y &=& g(x) \\
   d_{out} &=& f'(y) \\
   f'_x(g(x)) &=&  g'(x) \times d_{out} \\
   \end{eqnarray*}


The above derivative function tells us to compute the derivative of the
first function (:math:`g`), and then
times the derivative of the second function (:math:`f`) with respect to the
output the
first function.

Here is where the perspective of thinking of functions as boxes comes in handy:

.. image:: figs/Autograd/chain2.png
           :align: center

It shows that the :math:`d_{out}` multiplier passed to `backward` of the
first box (left) should be the value returned by `backward` of the second box.


A similar approach works for two-argument functions:

.. math::

   \begin{eqnarray*}
  f'_x(g(x, y)) &=& g_x'(x, y) \times f'_{g(x, y)}(g(x, y)) \\
  f'_y(g(x, y)) &=& g_y'(x, y) \times f'_{g(x, y)}(g(x, y))
  \end{eqnarray*}

Or

.. math::

   \begin{eqnarray*}
   z &=& g(x, y) \\
   d_{out} &=& f'(z) \\
   f'_x(g(x, y)) &=& g_x'(x, y) \times d_{out} \\
   f'_y(g(x, y)) &=& g_y'(x, y) \times d_{out}
   \end{eqnarray*}

This shows that the second box (:math:`f`) does not care how many arguments
the first
box (:math:`g`) has, as long as it passes back :math:`d_{out}` which is
enough for the chain rule
to work.
